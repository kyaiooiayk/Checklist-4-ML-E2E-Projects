#  üìãChecklist-4-ML-E2E-Projectsüìã
Checklist for Machine Learning Projects. An almost incomplete collections MLOPs incomplete bullet points. This list serves two purpouses:
- Provides a check list for things that are obvious but are really done or mostly forgotten
- Provides a step-by-step guide to ML project
***

## Scoping
<details>
<summary>Expand ‚¨áÔ∏è</summary>
<br>

-  What is the project main objective?
-  Which part of the main objective a ML is addressing?
-  Establish a baseline against which your ML will be considered an improvement
-  Are there any solutions not based on a ML model?
-  Choose: KPIs	(key performance indicators)
-  Monitor your project's objective over time.
- Talk to the domain expertes, they are those with the domain knowledge.

- Data sourcing/collection/ingestion	
    - Collect your data from the web via scraping
    - Build your own dataset
    - Create/augment your data with some synthetic data generation techniques
    - Dowload some open source. Best resource is probably [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Data versioning
- Data labeling
- Data schema which help validate the data. Especially for [concept drift](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-concept-drift-machine-learning/)
- Data verification/validation
- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
