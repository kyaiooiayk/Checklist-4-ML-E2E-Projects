- 📈📉 Establish a [baseline](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/3-baselines/) against which your ML will be considered an successful (an improvement against the baseline)
- ❓ Are there any solutions not based on a ML model? You are likely to be asked to compared your method against some no-ML model!
