#  📋Checklist-4-ML-E2E-Projects📋
Checklist for ML projects. An almost incomplete collections of MLOPs bullet points. This list serves three purpouses:
- Provides a **checklist** for things that are obvious but are rarely done/mostly forgotten
- Provides a **step-by-step** guide (template) to ML project
- Provides **links & references**
***

## Scoping
<details>
<summary>Expand ⬇️</summary>
<br>

- ❓ What is the project main objective(s)?
- ❓ Which part of the main objective the ML model(s) is addressing?
- 📈📉 Establish a [baseline](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2020/08/31/3-baselines/) against which your ML will be considered successful (an improvement against the baseline)
- ❓ Are there any solutions not based on a ML model? You are likely to be asked to compared your method against some no-ML model!
- Choose the business KPIs (key performance indicators). These are what businesses use to measure the uplift brought in by the ML-based solution.
- 📈 Monitor your project's objective(s) over time
- 🗣️ Talk to the domain experts, they are those with the domain knowledge

## Data
<details>
<summary>Expand ⬇️</summary>
<br>

- Data sourcing/collection/ingestion:
    - Collect your data from the web via scraping
    - Build your own dataset
    - Create/augment your data with some synthetic data generation techniques
    - Dowload some open source. Best resource is probably [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Data versioning
- Data cleaning
- Data labeling
- Establish a data schema which helps validate the data. Especially for [concept drift](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-concept-drift-machine-learning/)
- 💽 Data storage:
    - Structured data: SQL
    - Unstructured data: NoSQL
- Data transformation
- EDA (Exploratory Design Analysis)
- Build an ETL (Extra, Transform & Load) pipeline

## Modelling
<details>
<summary>Expand ⬇️</summary>
<br>
 
- Feature(s) vs. target(s)
- Model versioning
-  🐣 Create a baseline model
- Keep track of your model dependencies
- Feature selection
- Feature engineering
- Model metrics (Not model objective function and not necessarily KPIs!)    
- Model CV (Cross Valisation)
- Model hyperparameters:
    - Grid search
    - Successive halving
    - BOHB
- Model inference:
    - on CPUs
    - on GPUs
    - on TPUs
- Model serialisation (aka model persistence) / deserialisation:
    - joblib
    - pickle
    - skops
    - ONNX
- Model optimisation:
    - Quantisation
    - Pruning
    - Teacher-student models

</details>

## Deployment
<details>
<summary>Expand ⬇️</summary>
<br>

- No of model to be served. Serving is different from deployment.
- Service end point:
    - [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): fast and a good solution for testing, has limitation when it comes to clients' request workload
    - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/): it is less complex but not as complete as Dijango
    - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): for most advanced stuff
- Deplyment patters:
    - Canary
    - Green/blue
- Monitoring:
    - Latency
    - IO
    - Memory
    - Uptime: system reliability
    - Load testing: Apache Jmeter
- Kubernetes cluster:
    - Cloud vendors:
        - EKS by Amazon
        - AKS by Microsoft
        - GKS by Google
    - Local machine:
        - minikube
        - kind
        - k3s
