#  📋Checklist-4-ML-E2E-Projects📋
Checklist for Machine Learning Projects. An almost incomplete collections of MLOPs bullet points. This list serves three purpouses:
- Provides a checklist for things that are obvious but are really done or mostly forgotten
- Provides a step-by-step guide to ML project
- Provides links and references

## Scoping
<details>
<summary>Expand ⬇️</summary>

-  What is the project main objective?
-  Which part of the main objective a ML is addressing?
-  Establish a baseline against which your ML will be considered an improvement
-  Are there any solutions not based on a ML model?
-  Choose: KPIs	(key performance indicators)
-  📈 Monitor your project's objective over time.
-  🗣️ Talk to the domain expertes, they are those with the domain knowledge.
